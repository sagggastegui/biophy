# First we do the preparation step program:

   - preparation.ipynb, this step modifies our molecule by removing specific atoms and adding hydrogen.

# Now first step:
   - step1-interface-res.ipynb
     Here we find the contacts between residues in different chains as well as their distance
     
# Now second step:
   - step2-energy_evaluation.ipynb
     Here we calculate the energies of the protein: the energy of all the residues on the interface, Total energy binding energy
   - alanine change, effect of replacing each interface residue with alanine
   - We have three text files with the results of these programs 

# Now third step:
   - step3-plot.Rmd
     This is the plot of out previous results

# Finally fourth step
   - step4_picture.psw
     To see this you have to download it because it is a pymol file, we arranged the structure of the protein on pymol and colored the residues depending on their importance.
